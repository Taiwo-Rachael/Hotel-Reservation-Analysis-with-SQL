# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-with-SQL
Data is important in every industry, and the hotel industry is not an exception. Data helps hotel businesses to make informed decisions necessary for improving guest experiences, optimizing operations, and driving revenue.  

This hotel reservation analysis, which I carried out in the course of my internship at Mentorness, focused on writing SQL queries in order to answer key business questions, extract actionable insights and provide recommendations for business optimization based on the results of the analysis. 

# Business Questions
Some of the business questions this analysis set out to answer include:
1. What were the total number of reservations made?
2. What meal plan was most popular among customers?
3. What was the average price per room for reservations involving children?
4. What was the most commonly booked room type?
5. What Market segment was generating the highest average price per room?
6. What was the highest and lowest lead time for reservations?

The analysis provided answer to these questions and others, providing valuable insights and helping the business understand the reservation behaviours of their customers. 

# Insights Presentation 
The insights from this analysis were presented to stakeholders through a PowerPoint and Video Presentation, highlighting key findings and providing recommendations for optimization.
